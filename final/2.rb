# Write a section of a program that declares a class called ThisClass. It should have just one method, an initialize method that sets an instance variable called @this_name to equal a value you pass when you call ThisClass.new.

# You may write your class within this file.
# Bonus question, what should the name of the file be: __________________.rb
