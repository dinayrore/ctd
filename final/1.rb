# Write a program that asks the user to enter their age. It then outputs "Hooray!" for each year all in one line.

# It then asks the user if they feel old. If the user says "yes" then tell the user that they are wise. It they say "no" tell the user that they have much to learn. If they say anything else tell them that only time will tell.


# Write your code below. A word to the wise, use comments to preconstruct the problem. Don't forget to run your code before you submit it!
